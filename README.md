# AI Team - Mattermost Integration

## Overview

Getting things done isn't just about an individual person talking to universal AI assistant, 
rather it is about having a set of AI assistants working together as a team. To do this, a
discrete chat system is required. 

Using Mattermost as a Chat Integration platform, the purpose of this service is to connect Mattermost to an OpenAI Assistant model.
